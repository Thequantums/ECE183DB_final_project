To run the simulation, go to "worlds" folder and open "RCAP_show.wbt".

The simulation RCAP_show.wbt shows two robots moving on their individual trajectories. It has three predefined trajectories which are chosen
randomly when the simulation starts. The predefined trajectories are intended to show the deadlock scenario and the block path scenario.

There are two constraints on the RCAP:
1. The final goal node of one robot cannot block the path of another robot's trajectory
2. Only one robot is allowed to move at a time
